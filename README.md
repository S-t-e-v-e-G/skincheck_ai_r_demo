## SKINCHECK-ai-R

**SUMMARY:**
<br/>
Working demo of project as part of Le Wagon Tokyo data science bootcamp. Project aimed to reduce impact of skin cancer by making scanning and screening accessible.
<br/>

**OVERVIEW:**
<br/>
There are ~7M cases of Skin Cancer globally. We believed that by making screening and scanning more accessible it could help reduce the impact that skin cancer has.

As part of a Data Science and AI development bootcamp at Le Wagon Tokyo, we developed a working model to help detect skin cancer from an image submitted by a user.
We used transfer learning in combination with our own CNN to detect cases and hosted a working version using Google Cloud Run and Streamlit.
